# Building an order-based swap decentralised platform on Celo using Foundry

In this tutorial, we will explore the process of building an order-based swap smart contract on the Celo blockchain utilizing the powerful features of Foundry. By leveraging the capabilities of Foundry, we can create a robust and efficient platform for executing order-based swaps. Join me as we delve into the step-by-step development process, covering the necessary concepts, tools, and code examples required to build this smart contract.
